Creamy sauce clinging to perfectly al dente spaghetti, speckled with freshly ground black pepper. Crispy guanciale pieces scattered throughout, with visible rendered fat glistening under the light. Two perfectly separated egg yolks sit nestled on top, vibrant orange and ready to be mixed in. The pasta is served in a rustic, shallow white ceramic bowl with a slightly textured surface. Soft, diffused natural light from a window illuminates the scene from the left, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures. Shallow depth of field, focusing on the center of the bowl and blurring the background. Background is a dark, out-of-focus wooden table. Shot with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, 50mm lens, f/2.8, ISO 200. Composition: Rule of thirds, with the pasta slightly off-center. Focus on appetizing textures and creamy sauce.\n","model":"stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0-with-gemini-enhancement"}
